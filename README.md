About This Project
This project is a web-based Hangman game that allows players to guess a word by selecting letters. The game provides various categories of words and includes engaging animations, sound effects, and interactive elements to enhance the user experience.

Structure of the Game
HTML and CSS: The game's interface is built using HTML and CSS, creating a responsive design with elements such as the word display, keyboard, and category selector.

JavaScript: The core logic of the game is implemented in JavaScript, which handles:

Game Initialization: When a player selects a category, the game begins by picking a random word from the selected category and displays blank spaces representing each letter of the word.
Letter Guessing: Players interact with the game by clicking on letters. The game checks if the selected letter is in the word. If correct, the letter is revealed; if incorrect, a part of the hangman is drawn.
Game Over: The game ends when the player either guesses all the letters correctly or makes too many incorrect guesses. Appropriate messages and animations are shown depending on the outcome.
Sound and Animation: The game includes sound effects for correct and incorrect guesses, background music, and a confetti animation for when the player wins.
Hints: Players can request hints, which are displayed in a popup window. This feature adds another layer of interaction and support for players.

Key Components
categories: A set of predefined categories, each containing a list of words and corresponding hints.
audioList: A collection of audio files used for different sound effects during the game.
Keyboard Initialization: Dynamically generates the on-screen keyboard that players use to guess letters.
Canvas Drawing: The hangman drawing is rendered on a canvas element, which updates as the player makes incorrect guesses.
Event Listeners: JavaScript event listeners handle user interactions, such as button clicks, to ensure a smooth and responsive gameplay experience.
Reset and Play Again: After each round, players can reset the game or choose a new category to play again, keeping the experience fresh and engaging.
This project demonstrates how a simple word-guessing game can be enhanced with modern web development techniques, creating an enjoyable and interactive experience for users.
